          Bulga is a weary hamlet on the fringe of the largest wilderness in Australia’s southeast – a grizzled landscape of razor cliffs, plummeting canyons and dark canopy that stretches for nearly half-a-million wild acres. Saddleback Ridge, arched and forested, forms a sliver of green across the farmed lowlands on the settlement’s other side, the northeast. Filling out this panorama is a small, dense woodland, populated by squirrel gliders and glossy black cockatoos. It rests on blown sand dunes carried by winds 18,000 years ago – a hardy, gnarled place that is the last remaining of its kind on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the lushly magnificent Upper Hunter Valley of old; how we might imagine it when the fabled English ornithologist, John Gould and his artist wife, Elizabeth, travelled the 200 km north from Sydney. to the Upper Hunter 172 years ago,  The scene prompted Elizabeth to write:
        </p>
        <p>
          Found the tent pitched in a cleard (sic) spot in the midst of the bush where nature appeared in her wild luxuriance. The Immense parasites twining round the trees taking root some of them at the tops of the trees and hanging down to the ground, others surrounding the trees like a crown – heard the bell bird with his incessant ting ting, the coachwhip bird – a heavy shower of rain accompanied by lightening – soon cleared up – every green thing looked more beautiful for its sprinkling.
        </p>
        <p>
          [pic gallery of Gould’s watercolours of birds native to this area -- 3 to 5 images]
        </p>
        <p>
          The Goulds’ journey – it would help produce their celebrated seven-volume, exquisitely illustrated Birds of Australia – has enchanted nature lovers through the decades, none more so than Dr Glenn Albrecht, a dark, soft-spoken West Australian-born philosopher.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a younger man, he retraced the couple’s journey through the Hunter. His travels would spawn a small book and, later, a large idea – a notion that there was a gathering sickness of the mind across the Hunter Valley and elsewhere; a creeping illness that could strike any community in which the landscape was under assault. A homesickness when one was still at home.

          Coal has been riven from the Hunter Valley’s 15,000 square kilometres for 200 years. For many of those years the mines managed to tolerably co-exist with the Hunter’s reputation as the Tuscany of the direst continent on the earth. This was a valley of rolling vineyards, rambling dairy farms, expensive horse studs, sentient villages, stone churches and country mansions.
        </p>
        <p>
          [tba pic gallery of postcards/tourist type photos from the area]
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past few decades the open coal pits, spurred by rising coal prices, have cratered called the valley. Villages have been swallowed, coal trains rumble day and night, roads are choked.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days some 114 million tonnes of black coal – much of it exported through the world’s largest black-coal port in the nearby city of Newcastle – leaves the Hunter every year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ranges of over-burden – a miners’ term for the thousands of tonnes of soil and rock blasted away to get to the coal – line the valley like enlarged grave mounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around the year 2000, when coal mining in the Hunter began to truly accelerate – and black coal extraction has almost doubled since – Albrecht, then associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Newcastle, was increasingly sought out the distraught.
        </p>
        <p>
          “These were rural people,” Albrecht recalls. “And they wanted to live with clean air beautiful night skies, wildlife, fresh water. And every one of those dimensions of the normal were being taken away from them in such a way that they had no control or power.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The sense of powerlessness among the people of the valley led Albrecht – now director of the Institute of Sustainability and Technology Policy at Western Australia’s Murdoch University – to think they were suffering not just from living amid a landscape that was being massively changed by coal mining; they were vulnerable to a hitherto unrecognised psychological condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Albrecht called it solastalgia – a word he derived from the Latin solacium (comfort) and the Greek root algia (pain). He defined it, in a 2004 essay, as “the pain experienced when there is recognition that the place where one resides and that one loves is under immediate assault”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glenn Albrecht’s wistful description did not slow the coal frenzy – the mines continued to spread.
        </p>
        <p>
          But so, too, did word of solastalgia.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2009 the British trip-hop duo Zero 7 brought out a track called Solastalgia. The year before, Jukeen, a Slovenian recording artist, used the word as an album title. The term has been used to describe the experiences of Canadian Inuit communities dealing with global warming, farmers in Africa coping with climate change – even impoverished people returning to what was left of their homes in New Orleans after hurricane Katrina.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it was the people of Bulga – nestled in the Hunter where the possible existence of such an ailment first came to Glenn Albrecht’s attention – who eight weeks ago took solastalgia into a Sydney Court.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never had the concept had been put before a Judge. They wanted the Judge to do what few have done before in Australia; tell one of the world’s biggest coal miners that it could not take its open cut coal mine any closer to their town.
        </p>
        <p>
          That Judge agreed. The miners’ remain incensed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This the story of the tiny town that fought back. And what is revealed when a Court takes apart a big coal miner’s case. And the way in which a government acceded to the miner.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
